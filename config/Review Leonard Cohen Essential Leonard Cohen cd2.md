Essential Leonard Cohen (cd2) is a great introduction to Cohen's rich and diverse musical legacy. It demonstrates his ability to blend different genres and styles, from folk to rock to synth-pop to world music. It also showcases his lyrical brilliance, his spiritual depth, and his dark humor. Whether he sings about love, politics, religion, or death, he always does so with grace, honesty, and wisdom.
 
Essential Leonard Cohen (cd2) is a must-have for any fan of Leonard Cohen or anyone who appreciates great songwriting. It is part of Sony BMG's The Essential series, which also includes Essential Leonard Cohen (cd1), a compilation of his earlier songs from 1967 to 1984. Together, they form a comprehensive overview of Cohen's remarkable career and contribution to music history.
  
One of the highlights of Essential Leonard Cohen (cd2) is "Hallelujah", Cohen's most famous and covered song. Originally released in 1984 on his album Various Positions, the song gained popularity after being covered by Jeff Buckley in 1994. Since then, it has been performed by hundreds of artists, including John Cale, Rufus Wainwright, k.d. lang, and Pentatonix. The song is a haunting and beautiful meditation on faith, doubt, love, and loss. Cohen himself has said that the song is about "the struggle between having human desire and searching for spiritual wisdom".
 
Another standout track is "Waiting for the Miracle", which was featured in the 1994 film Natural Born Killers. The song is a dark and cynical commentary on the state of the world and the human condition. Cohen sings about the futility of waiting for a miracle to save us from ourselves, while acknowledging that we are still drawn to the idea of salvation. The song has a hypnotic and ominous melody, enhanced by Cohen's deep and gravelly voice.
 
Essential Leonard Cohen (cd2) also includes some of Cohen's more uplifting and hopeful songs, such as "Dance Me to the End of Love" and "Closing Time". The former is a romantic and passionate song inspired by Cohen's relationship with actress Rebecca De Mornay. The latter is a playful and celebratory song about enjoying life and having fun. Both songs showcase Cohen's lighter and more humorous side, as well as his musical versatility.
